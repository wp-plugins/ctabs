Content Tabs (cTabs) allows you to post content into seperate tabs on a page using shortcodes. [shortcodes] .

== Description ==

Why do you need it? It makes things so much easier when you have a lot of content to put on one page and tabs would be ideal. cTabs lets you add a tabbed content area directly in your post or page, without having to edit the theme template.

cTabs comes with a nice default style but you can edit it anyway you would like through the built in CSS editor in options menu. If you change the css and want to go back to the default, just reset the css in the options menu.
